If home is where the <3 is then put my <3 in hardware and call it heart-ware. Immortalise the rhythm of its beat in a loop() and encapsulate the love that it holds in a DAO. <br>

One of the most beautiful yet incomprehensible wonders of our world is the sky. It was there at the beginning and it will cease to exist at the end. It is home to gods and goddesses, the sun and the moon, weather and wildlife. Within the sky are these enormous clusters of candyfloss, dense enough to materialise yet fragile enough to move with the wind. Always present and forever out of reach. Our data is in the clouds now too… Memories in the form of JPEGs, journeys documented by Google Maps and behaviour predicted by algorithms and AI. All stored in the almighty cloud. The invisible cloud that is both everywhere and nowhere at once, the cloud with no consequences or limitations. <br>

The trustworthy cloud promises that we can no longer lose things or run out of space. <br>
The observant cloud might even recognise your face. <br>
And the friendly cloud wants to gain access and faith. <br>

The word “avatar” finds its origins in Hinduism; “_a manifestation of a deity or released soul in bodily form on earth; an incarnate divine teacher._” Now, the word has been recontextualised and a new, digital form is required for browsing through cyberspace. If you browse hard enough you may find that you get lost in the clouds… The cursor is an extension of the body, an avatar of a sort, shape-shifting and granting access through clicks and double clicks. It dances across the screen, reminding us of its parameters as it hits the edges. <br>

>‘Hertz’s hands reference the interface hands and, as I have  already suggested, become “our” hands if we can mesh with these depictions [^1].'
[^1]: M. White, The Body and the Screen. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006. p. 19.

If you have a moment to build a connection with your cursor before reading on, type “_editor.p5js.org_” into your browser. Press the play button at the top-left of the screen and tick “_Auto-refresh_” (a grey square should appear beneath “_preview_” on the right). Now, take your cursor to the end of line six and hit the enter key. On line seven, type: “_ellipse (mouseX, mouseY, 50)_”. Now move your cursor around the grey square and enjoy the duality for a short while. <br>

Dance with your cursor! Allow it to lead you on a journey through the web. Play with the cursor, customise it, grab it, click it, become it. Use it to write your name, mark your territory, tag the net! Although beware of the sinister red serpent. It lives in the machine, waiting to slither beneath unrecognised words. <br>

Our avatars continue to grow and manifest in cyberspace, beyond the cursor, beneath the gaze of the cloud. Yes, we are reincarnated through avatar creators in games; built to try to achieve sweet simulation. But we take on various, subtle avatar forms when surfing the web. From the shallow puddles of text input, through to the dark waves of the uncanny valley. Endless accounts have been made that document name, email address and date of birth. Profile images are uploaded, cropped, copied and pasted whilst the smartphone camera is capturing, recognising and editing. <br>

>'By comparing what you and your network already photographed, the algorithm guesses what you might have wanted to photograph now. It creates the present picture based on earlier pictures, on your/its memory [^2].'

Building avatars and imaginary landscapes. Browsing histories, text prediction, digital signatures, social media. Even the forgotten SD cards and USB sticks. We sail between soft bodies, software and hardware. Fragmented. Not all of us fit yet, but a web built on open source fundamentals that provides development skills can help us build a home much stronger than forward slashes and square brackets. <br>

Or perhaps to find home, one should simply look up at the sky. <br>

## Glossary
**Loop** – Repeats a sequence of code until it is told to stop <br>
**DAO** - Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (community-led groups that find a home on the blockchain) <br>
**JPEG** - A type of digital image <br>
**Algorithm** –- A set of instructions that computers follow, they are sometimes used to automate decisions <br>
**AI** - Artificial Intelligence (a simulation of  intelligence), I am not quite sure who defined it as artificial <br>
**Uncanny Valley** - The weird feeling that you get when a robot/avatar looks like a human but isn’t quite there <br>
